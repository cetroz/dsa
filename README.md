Implementation of commonly used data structures and algorithms in Python.

I wrote these to learn about them, and also to make them available for other people to read and check for themselves.

### Guide
The file structure is to be as follows:
```
src/
    ds/
        linked_list/
        queue/
        ...
    algs/
        djikstra/
        bfs/
        ...
```

All the data structure and algorithm code is present in `src/ds` and `src/algs` respectively.

Documentation is in progress for the usage of each data structure and algorithm alongwith a TL;DR-style expalanation.
