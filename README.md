Implementation of commonly used data structures and algorithms in Python.

I wrote these to learn about them, and also to make them available to other people to read and check for themselves.

### Usage
Each data structure is present inside `src/ds` with each folder named after the data structure, and same goes for the algorithms.

Documentation is a work in progress.
